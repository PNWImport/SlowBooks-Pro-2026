# Slowbooks Pro 2026

**A personal bookkeeping application raised from the ashes of QuickBooks 2003 Pro.**

Free, source-available, and complete: double-entry accounting, unlimited
invoicing, US payroll with tamper-evident tax forms, perpetual inventory,
bank feeds, analytics — with every record in local files you control. No
cloud, no account, no telemetry, no caps, no paid tiers. **Multi-user
Server Edition is built into the same signed installer — no Docker
required** (Docker remains an optional path for Linux servers).

**Get started:**

## The Story

I ran QuickBooks 2003 Pro for 14 years for side-business invoicing and
bookkeeping. Then the hard drive died. Intuit's activation servers have
been dead since ~2017, so the software can't be reinstalled. The license
I paid for is worthless.

So I built my own replacement, and transferred my data out of the old
.QBW file using IIF export/import. Early versions wore the grief openly —
the code was annotated with invented "decompilation" comments referencing
`QBW32.EXE` offsets and Btrieve table layouts as a tribute to software
that served me well until its maker decided it should stop working. The
codebase has since grown up; the last of those comments came out in
v2.14.0, and the fiction now lives only in this origin story. The
software never depended on it.

**This is an independent, from-scratch reimplementation.** No Intuit
source code or binaries were available, decompiled, or used.

## Accessibility

SlowBooks Pro strives to conform to WCAG 2.1 AA: labelled controls,
real dialogs, live notifications, and contrast improvements in both themes.
PDF generation requests PDF/UA-1 tagging; accessibility verification is ongoing.
Details, known gaps and how to report a barrier:
[docs/accessibility.md](docs/accessibility.md) and
[the accessibility page](https://www.slowbookspro.com/accessibility/).

## What's New

**v2.19 — Type to find it.** The pickers search as you type, as QuickBooks'
do: a customer, vendor, item, account, employee, job or class picker, or any
long list, narrows to what matches ("6500" finds 6500 Rent or Lease), and
"+ New Customer" opens its quick add with the name you typed. Screen readers
hear the picker's name, the number of matches and the highlighted one.

**v2.18 — Around the ledger.** Two of the QA agents each ran a brand-new
company for a day through the screens and checked every figure against the
ledger; this release fixes all sixty-eight things they found around it.
Pay Sales Tax works, supplier tax is part of a purchase's cost instead of
reducing the tax owed, Schedule C keeps expenses in expenses, customer and
vendor balances show what is owed, a customer's leftover payment can be
applied later, and every aging report ties to the balance sheet. Time
tracking works end to end, tax forms open in the Mac app, foreign-currency
invoices can be paid from the screen, and backups are kept and restored per
company. It also brings @Sciumo's QuickBooks Online import of journal
entries and posted ledger activity, with a live import log (#192), a switch
for the company logo on invoices, and **Fetch older history** for SimpleFIN
bank feeds — up to a year where the provider keeps it (#181). Tax rates take
four decimal places (8.875%), and the payment screens see every open invoice
and bill, not just the newest 500 (#191). Each company now keeps its logo,
attachments and employee documents in its own company file: companies on
one desktop shared them, and a server published them without a sign-in.
2.18.1 imports QuickBooks names without the quote marks QuickBooks puts
around a name with a comma, offers to bring ALL-CAPS names in as normal
capitalization (#195, @TheLocalW), imports the lines QuickBooks posts to a
sub-account, and keeps the permit form's format note off its boxes (#194,
@cnbarry1). 2.18.2 gives every form field a name a screen reader can say
(#198), says so when an import comes back with errors (#197), and lists
Claude and Grok first among the AI providers, with Claude on Sonnet 5.5
(#200).

**v2.17 — Your ledger, in a spreadsheet.** Trial Balance and General Ledger
save as a CSV and a printable PDF, and Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet gain
the CSV — amounts as plain numbers, ready to sum. The general ledger carries
a balance brought forward, a running balance and a period total that ties to
the trial balance. Bank feeds accept a setup token from any SimpleFIN
provider. Asked for by @cnbarry1 (#179, #181). 2.17.1 makes AI analysis
work again with OpenAI's current models (#185, @Sciumo); 2.17.2 stops an
invoice edit from stripping its job costing (#187, @Bit-Sage); 2.17.3 makes
Pay Bills pay each vendor separately and keeps every payment on its own
customer's or vendor's documents (#189, @Bit-Sage).

**v2.16 — The year at a glance.** Two new overview cards, both opt-in under
Customize: **P&L: Year to Date** with cumulative net by month, and a
**Balance Sheet Trend** over the last twelve month-ends that balances at
every point and agrees with the report. Contributed by @jarvis4openclaw
(#166). The chart of accounts import offers a CSV template. 2.16.1 fixes
Wave's full export importing no journals after a passing dry run (#169);
2.16.2 stops charging tax to non-taxable customers, widens every money
column for large-denomination currencies (#173), and puts the estimate and
job-cost forms right (#174, #176); 2.16.3 lets a fresh Docker image start again.

**v2.15 — Your chart, from your file.** Import a chart of accounts from a
CSV in the export's columns, any spreadsheet with Number / Name / Type, or
hledger's account list. A dry run shows every row's fate first; existing and
control accounts are renamed in place, never duplicated. Asked for by
@tresero (#139, #161).

**Branch updates after upstream 2.19.0 — unreleased** (upstream 2.19.0 is merged; the work below is not yet in the installer downloads):

- **Payroll and HR:** expanded contractor runs, schedules, locations, retro pay,
  benefits and workers' comp; employee portal time submission, corrected deposit
  calendars, bank-holiday/blackout handling, and reliable save refreshes.
- **Accounting integrity:** fix lost balances under concurrent journal writes,
  guard repeated processing/reversals, prevent document-audit chain forks, and
  commit signatures together with their audit records.
- **Security and operations:** stronger session checks, private uploads, PII
  redaction and signed audit checkpoints; hardened Docker/server defaults,
  preserved encryption keys, and verified backup/restore and migration paths.
- **Performance:** bounded transaction lists and fewer database queries; a
  synthetic 50,000-invoice/150,000-line workload completed 192 page reads without
  errors. This is a bounded test, not enterprise capacity certification.

**Continued beta validation — October 5, 2026:** 6,547 passed, 12
documented conditional skips, zero failures; 96.92% statement coverage
with SQLite, PostgreSQL 17, native OCR and all 47 Chromium cases passing.
The rebuilt beta passed stale payroll-cap handling, exact draft cancellation,
ordinary taxable employer contributions and retro-pay boundary checks. Actual
image checks passed backup recovery across all 101 tables, strict HTTPS,
native OCR and Kubernetes deployment. Alembic head: `b7fringe2026105`.
The [current beta checklist](docs/beta-continuation-2026-10-05.md) records exact
source/image hashes, final results, evidence and remaining gates. The
[first beta audit](docs/beta-readiness-2026-10-05.md) retains its broader
accounting, nonprofit and frontend observations, including 85 Node tests,
11 live workflows and 154 axe audit occurrences, with their original build
provenance. Earlier snapshots remain in [validation history](docs/validation.md).

**Still required before public release:** unsupported special fringe and
historical payroll reconciliation; state/local classification verification;
supporting release-image updates; signed native-platform and live-provider
acceptance; human accessibility, deployment capacity and independent security
review; hosted CI/code-owner review and author signoffs.
Existing installs should follow the
[concurrency-fix upgrade checks](docs/operations.md#concurrency-fix-upgrade-checks);
these fixes do not repair historical balance drift or audit-chain damage.
Feature details: [payroll/HR guide](docs/payroll-hr-module.md).

**v2.9 — Nonprofit mode.** One switch in Settings and a church, a club, a
PTO or a community arts group sees its own words — donors, pledges,
donations, funds, grants — and gets the documents every treasurer and
auditor asks for: net assets by restriction with a release-from-restriction
document, the Statement of Activities and Statement of Financial Position,
fund balances, a Statement of Functional Expenses fed by allocation rules
that split rent and wages across program / management / fundraising, donor
acknowledgments with the IRS language, in-kind gifts, pledge tracking with
write-offs, and year-end giving statements. Everything reconciles to the
P&L and balance sheet to the cent. Guide:
[docs/nonprofit-module.md](docs/nonprofit-module.md).

![Nonprofit mode on macOS and Windows: the Company Snapshot in donor words, the Statement of Functional Expenses, the Statement of Activities compared to prior year, Releases from Restriction, the Report Center in dark theme, and a Pledge Report PDF](screenshots/nonprofit-grid.png)

**v2.7 — Jobs, job costing, and receipt intake.** QuickBooks-style
Customer:Job on every form and every posted line, nested cost codes with
cost types and burden, Job Cost Entries for labor / equipment / mileage /
overhead, time posted to jobs at loaded rates, budgets seeded from
estimates, and a job page that drills from cost type to code to the
posted line with Budget / Committed / Actual / Projected / Variance — the
columns contractors already read. QuickBooks `Customer:Job` and Online
sub-customers import as jobs. Plus **receipt intake**: scan a receipt
photo or PDF into a Bill, Expense or Sales Receipt with a box-to-fix
canvas, using the OCR engine built into macOS and Windows (Tesseract on
Linux). Design notes: [docs/design/projects.md](docs/design/projects.md).

**v2.6 — Sales receipts.** Point-of-sale style sales on one screen: the
sale and its payment recorded together, deposited where you say, posted
atomically — and kept on their own page so they don't clutter your
invoices. Your existing receipt history imports too: `CASH SALE` blocks
from QuickBooks Desktop IIF files and the SalesReceipt entity over the
QuickBooks Online connection, with a migration guide covering both paths
([docs/migrate-from-quickbooks.md](docs/migrate-from-quickbooks.md)).
Built because a user asked for it.

**v2.5 — Server Edition.** The same signed installer can serve your whole
office from one Windows PC: users with roles (admin / bookkeeper /
read-only), username logins, per-user audit attribution, and a startup
task that has the books serving before anyone logs in — everyone else
just needs a browser. An edition is a state, not a SKU: add a second user
and you've promoted yourself, free either way. Field-verified on real
office hardware before release. See
**[docs/server-edition.md](docs/server-edition.md)**.

v2.5 also debuts the **signed & notarized Apple Silicon macOS app**
(maintained by [@ContractorKeith](https://github.com/ContractorKeith)) —
a native `.app` in a DMG, no Docker or Python required.

![Server Edition: LAN-served dashboard and user management](screenshots/server-edition-grid.png)

**v2.4 — Bank feeds & the AI-ready API.** Automatic transaction sync via
[SimpleFIN](https://www.simplefin.org/) — you hold the bank credential,
no middleman server, dedup + bank rules on arrival
([docs/setup-bank-feeds.md](docs/setup-bank-feeds.md)). Every install
also serves a self-documenting local REST API (617 operations in this branch); point
Claude Code or any agentic CLI at it —
[slowbookspro.com/ai](https://www.slowbookspro.com/ai/) has the
paste-prompt.

**v2.3 — Migrate from anywhere.** One Migrate Data page for Xero, MYOB,
Sage 50, Wave, Zoho Books, and GnuCash — every import dry-run-verified
against your trial balance before a single record is written, with
opening balances posted automatically.

Full history in **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**.

## Wait — it does *that*?

**Cryptographically tamper-evident tax forms.** Every W-2, W-3, 940, and
941 PDF carries a SHA-256 content hash and audit ID printed in the
footer. An auditor can recompute the hash and confirm the form hasn't
been edited since generation, against the local `document_audits` chain.
Not a watermark — a verification trail.

**Bring-your-own-AI, including your own gateway.** AI Insights runs
against any of eight providers (xAI Grok, Groq, Cloudflare Workers AI,
Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini, a Cloudflare Worker you host
yourself, or a public-HTTPS OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint) — keys encrypted at rest with versioned, rotatable ciphertext.
See [provider setup and compatibility limits](docs/ai-providers.md).
And the whole app is agent-operable through its local API: see the
[AI setup guide](https://www.slowbookspro.com/ai/).

**One-click reseller-permit verification.** Per-state format validation
(WA/CA/TX), one click opens the state's official lookup, and the
who-and-when verification trail lands on the customer record.

**Boots refuse to lie to you.** Dev and debug containers run the
frontend↔backend wiring audit *before* uvicorn binds the port — drift
between the JS and the routes fails the boot instead of 404-ing
mid-feature. Release images gate on the same check in CI.

## Quick Start

### Windows — signed installer

Download **[SlowBooksPro-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest/download/SlowBooksPro-Setup-x64.exe)**
and double-click. Fully self-contained (64-bit Windows 10/11); a portable
.zip is on the [releases page](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest)
— it needs the Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime, which Windows 11 has and the
installer sets up; without it the app offers to open in your browser instead.
Each company is one SQLite file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro` —
upgrades and even uninstalls never touch your books.

**Serve the office (Server Edition):** on the host PC, run the bundled
`serveredition-install.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell — firewall,
startup task, and machine-wide data location handled. Details in
[docs/server-edition.md](docs/server-edition.md).

### macOS — signed Apple Silicon app

Download **[SlowBooksPro-macos-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest/download/SlowBooksPro-macos-arm64.dmg)**,
drag **SlowBooks Pro** to Applications, launch. Signed and notarized with
the project's Apple Developer ID on every release; macOS 14+, Apple
Silicon. Intel Macs: Docker.

### Docker (Linux servers, Intel Mac)

Docker is optional — multi-user LAN serving on Windows is **Server
Edition**, built into the signed installer above (no containers involved).
Docker remains the path for Linux servers and Intel Macs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
cd SlowBooks-Pro-2026
cp .env.example .env
# Set PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET_KEY in .env to separate
# values generated with: openssl rand -hex 32. Generate SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY
# with the Docker command documented in .env.example. Generate the audit signing
# key there too; keep all four stable.
# For this localhost-only Compose setup, set FORCE_HTTPS=false in .env.
# Keep BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1; network-facing deployments require TLS.
docker compose up
```

Open **http://localhost:3001** — PostgreSQL, migrations, and seed data
are automatic. The image includes `tesseract-ocr` and `poppler-utils` so
receipt scanning works out of the box; native installs add them with
`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr poppler-utils` (optional — scanning
degrades gracefully when they're absent).

Native installs, demo data, troubleshooting: **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.
Backups, restore, key rotation: **[docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md)**.
Production checklist: **[docs/release-checklist.md](docs/release-checklist.md)**.

## Tech Stack

Python + FastAPI on PostgreSQL (SQLite for tests and desktop companies,
one file each) with SQLAlchemy 2.0 and Alembic. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
single-page app — no framework, no build step. WeasyPrint + Jinja2 for
PDFs; self-hosted Chart.js (no CDN, LAN-deployable). Hosted-checkout
payments only — card data never touches the app. Port 3001.

The Windows and Apple Silicon desktop builds freeze the same codebase
with PyInstaller + pywebview. Both sign in CI on every release tag:
Windows via Azure Trusted Signing, macOS with the project's Apple
Developer ID — signed, notarized, and stapled on the runner (signing
credentials live only in repo secrets, never in the repo).
