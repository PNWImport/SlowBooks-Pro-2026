# PyInstaller spec for the native macOS build (.app bundle).
#
# STARTING POINT — adapted from packaging/windows/SlowBooksPro.spec and
# not yet validated on real Apple hardware. Expected iteration areas:
#   * WeasyPrint natives: on macOS these come from Homebrew (pango,
#     fontconfig, gobject-introspection). PyInstaller's hooks usually pick
#     the dylibs up automatically from the brew prefix; if PDF rendering
#     fails in the frozen app, stage them explicitly like the Windows
#     build stages its gtk-dlls.
#   * pywebview uses the Cocoa/WebKit backend on macOS (pyobjc) — no
#     pythonnet, no WebView2, one less runtime dependency than Windows.
#   * Icon: assets/icon-256.png → .icns (see the workflow step).

# One HarfBuzz, and it must be Homebrew's (issue #141, reported by mdornich)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When Pillow's `_imagingft` is collected, PyInstaller brings Pillow's own
# HarfBuzz with it and the two builds collide under one install name:
#
#   PIL/.dylibs/libharfbuzz.0.dylib   Pillow's,   ~1.81 MB  <- owns the VERSIONED name
#   libharfbuzz.dylib                 Homebrew's, ~1.24 MB  <- unversioned ONLY
#   libharfbuzz-subset.0.dylib        Homebrew's, ~1.43 MB
#
# The `binaries` list above seeds Homebrew's under the versioned name, but
# PIL's hook wins the filename and Homebrew's real library lands unversioned
# where nothing resolves to it. Pango asks for @rpath/libharfbuzz.0.dylib and
# gets Pillow's, while libharfbuzz-subset is Homebrew's — and those symbols
# exist only in the Homebrew build. The first PDF render dies in native code.
#
# EXCLUDE THE MODULE, DO NOT DROP THE LIBRARY. That distinction is @macbase1's
# and it was measured, not argued. Removing Pillow's dylib from `a.binaries`
# after Analysis is too late, and fails two ways:
#
#   * on its own it leaves ZERO versioned copies, because Homebrew's is
#     already sitting under the unversioned name — an affected builder then
#     cannot build at all;
#   * re-seeding Homebrew's versioned name afterwards BUILDS, and produces a
#     DANGLING SYMLINK into PIL/, because PyInstaller creates the cross-link
#     before the spec removes the file under it. That bundle signs, notarizes,
#     and dies at the first PDF — the original symptom, reached by the repair.
#
# Excluding `PIL._imagingft` / `PIL.ImageFont` is early enough: the library is
# never collected, so Homebrew's keeps the versioned name it was seeded with.
#
# Safe because nothing in app/ draws text with Pillow — it appears only in
# ocr_service.py and ocr_regions.py, for image preprocessing, and neither
# imports ImageFont or ImageDraw. tests/test_macos_harfbuzz_collision.py fails
# if that ever stops being true.
#
# (An earlier version of this comment claimed the pinned wheel ships no raqm
# or fribidi, so shaping is off. @macbase1 measured pillow 12.3.0 from that
# same pin reporting `harfbuzz: True, raqm: True`. The conclusion stands but
# it rests only on the argument above, not on that one.)
