# PayPal Online Payments Setup

Accept PayPal payments on invoices alongside (or instead of) Stripe. When PayPal is enabled, the public invoice pay page shows a **Pay with PayPal** button; the customer approves on PayPal's hosted page, the payment is captured on return, and it auto-records in Slowbooks with the same journal entries as any online payment (DR Undeposited Funds / CR Accounts Receivable).

See `docs/setup-stripe.md` for the Stripe equivalent — both can be enabled at once.

## Prerequisites

- A PayPal Business account ([paypal.com/business](https://www.paypal.com/business))
- Slowbooks Pro running and accessible

---

## Step 1: Create a REST API app

1. Log in to the [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/)
2. Go to **Apps & Credentials**
3. Start in **Sandbox** mode (toggle at the top) for initial testing
4. Click **Create App**, name it (e.g. "Slowbooks"), and create it
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Secret** for the app

## Step 2: Configure Slowbooks

1. Open **Company Settings → Online Payments → PayPal**
2. Set **PayPal Payments** to Enabled
3. Set **Environment** to `Sandbox` (switch to `Live` after testing)
4. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. Save

## Step 3 (server installs): Add a webhook

Skip this on desktop installs — webhooks can't reach `127.0.0.1`; payments record automatically when the customer returns from PayPal, or via the **Check Payment Status** button on the invoice.

1. In the developer dashboard, open your app → **Webhooks** → **Add Webhook**
2. URL: `https://your-server/api/payments/paypal/webhook`
3. Subscribe to the event **Payment capture completed** (`PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`)
4. Save, then copy the **Webhook ID** into Slowbooks settings

## Step 4: Test in sandbox

1. Create a sandbox **personal** (buyer) account under **Testing Tools → Sandbox Accounts**
2. In Slowbooks, open an unpaid invoice → **Copy Payment Link** → open it in a private window
3. Click **Pay with PayPal**, log in with the sandbox buyer account, approve
4. On return you should see "Payment received — thank you!"
5. Verify in Slowbooks: the invoice is Paid, a payment row exists (method `paypal`), and the journal entry posted

## Going live

Switch the app credentials to the **Live** tab in the developer dashboard, paste the live Client ID/Secret into Slowbooks, set **Environment** to `Live`, and (server installs) recreate the webhook against the live app.

## Notes

- Amounts are charged in USD for the invoice's balance due at checkout time.
- Approval and capture are separate steps at PayPal; Slowbooks captures on the customer's return (idempotently), and the webhook is a second, redundant recording path on server installs.
- Refunds are issued from the PayPal dashboard; record them in Slowbooks as a credit memo.
