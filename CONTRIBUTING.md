# Contributing to SlowBooks Pro 2026

Thanks for considering a contribution. This is a small project — the
process is light, but a few conventions keep the codebase coherent.

## Before you start

For anything bigger than a typo or a one-line bug fix, open an issue
first so we can sanity-check direction before you write the code. Quick
fixes can just be a PR.

## How merges work

`main` is protected: every change lands through a pull request with a
code-owner (@VonHoltenCodes) review — that's enforced by GitHub, not
etiquette. Collaborators have full branch and Actions access: push
branches, trigger workflows, download artifacts. CI (black/ruff,
pytest, CodeQL, pip-audit) must be green before review.

## How releases work

A merged PR ships with the next release, not on merge. Every release goes
through a three-platform gate in the QA repo,
[SlowBooks-Pro-Testing](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-Testing):
a `release/<version>` PR there records the exact commit under test, each
platform (Windows 11, macOS on Apple Silicon, Linux + Docker/PostgreSQL)
installs the build from that commit and posts findings, and the tag is cut
from the recorded commit only. A fix the gate finds goes on top of the
release branch as an ordinary commit and the gate re-runs on the new
commit. The gate records are public; `reports/<version>/GATE.md` is the
checklist and each platform's findings file is the evidence.

## Upstream PR preparation — September 14, 2026

Upstream's current contribution and release procedure is recorded at
[`2866c90`](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/blob/2866c9066d36c1f4de978e21041f76a7395c1d24/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Before submitting this branch:

- Review its Contributor Terms and sign-off requirement with the contributor;
  do not add a sign-off on someone's behalf without their approval. This note
  does not replace this checkout's license or record acceptance of new terms.
- Preserve the local test counts and fixture documentation below. Upstream's
  shared-database fixture and release-version claims are not established here.
- Keep fixture passwords in named constants away from username literals;
  scripts must obtain passwords from the environment, without defaults.
- Supply real exported-file evidence for named third-party import formats;
  synthetic regression coverage alone is not format acceptance.
- Keep saved user email templates unchanged and verify business/nonprofit
  wording. Upstream targets USA deployments; do not claim unverified support.
- Run the full suite before pushing. Release acceptance is a separate
  Windows, Apple Silicon macOS, and Linux/Docker/PostgreSQL gate against an
  exact commit in the upstream testing repository, not a local coverage score.

Every release also carries its docs pass, before the tag: the README's
*What's New* and API count, `docs/features.md`, the CHANGELOG section and
`app/static/whats-new.json` here; and on the site, the version stamps, the
changelog entry, and the LLM-facing docs (`llms.txt`, the agent
instructions template, the AI page) describing the new surface the way an
agent needs it. A feature that takes a file ships a template for it.
`docs/release-checklist.md` has the list.

## First contribution? Fork — no access needed

Pushing a branch to this repo requires collaborator access, which new
contributors don't have (and don't need). The standard flow:

1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub (the Fork button, top right).
2. **Push your branch to the fork.** An existing clone doesn't need
   re-cloning — add the fork as a remote:

   ```sh
   git remote add fork https://github.com/<you>/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
   git checkout -b feat/my-topic
   # ...commit...
   git push -u fork feat/my-topic
   ```

3. **Open the PR against `main` here.** GitHub offers a "Compare &
   pull request" button as soon as you push. CI runs on fork PRs
   exactly as it does for collaborators; review and merge work the
   same. (Fork PRs can't see repo secrets or trigger the release
   workflows — that's by design, not a problem with your setup.)

Good work gets merged under your name; polish happens in follow-up
commits, so don't hold a PR hostage to perfection.

GitGuardian's GitHub App scans every PR and does not read the repo's
`.gitguardian.yaml` (that file configures the `ggshield` CLI only). Its
pair detector fires when a `"username"` and a `"password"` literal sit
next to each other in one object, so in tests keep fixture passwords in a
named constant away from the username key. Scripts take a password from
the environment (`SLOWBOOKS_QA_PASSWORD`), never as a default. Nothing in
this repository — test, fixture, docstring, default — is ever a real
credential.

## Platform maintainers

- **Windows, Linux, Docker, Server Edition**: @VonHoltenCodes. Windows
  releases are signed via Azure Trusted Signing in CI.
- **macOS**: [@ContractorKeith](https://github.com/ContractorKeith)
  maintains the `.app`/DMG build and release tooling in
  `packaging/macos/` and reviews macOS. Releases sign, notarize and staple
  in CI with the project's Apple Developer ID (credentials live only in
  repo secrets); Keith's local run of the same tooling is the documented
  fallback. Apple Silicon only — Intel Macs run the Docker image.
- **Release QA** runs in the testing repo above, one lane per platform,
  with a person at the installed program for the checks that need one.

## Branch naming

- `claude/<short-topic>` — branches authored by Claude Code or via the
  Claude Code on the web integration
- `fix/<short-topic>` — bug fixes
- `feat/<short-topic>` — new features
- `docs/<short-topic>` — documentation only
- `parked/<short-topic>` — work held back on purpose (see *Project rules*)
- Use kebab-case for the topic (`feat/portal-cookie-session`, not
  `feat/portal_cookie_session`)

## Commit messages

We don't enforce Conventional Commits, but commit messages should:

- Start with a short imperative subject line (≤ 70 chars), no period:
  - ✅ `Fix portal token expiry comparison on SQLite`
  - ❌ `fixed the portal thing`
- Explain *why* in the body if the change isn't obvious from the diff —
  what was broken, what the user-visible effect is, why this approach
  over alternatives. Wrap body lines around 72 chars.
- Reference related issues with `Fixes #123` or `Refs #45` in the body

Sign every commit off (`git commit -s`) — that line is how you agree to
the Contributor Terms at the end of this file. Commits authored via Claude
Code on the web carry a session URL at the bottom; leave that in.

## Code style

- **Python**: `black --check app/ tests/` and `ruff check app/ tests/`
  must pass. CI gates on both. Use `black app/ tests/` to auto-format.
- **JavaScript**: vanilla JS (no build step). Match the surrounding
  style; no semicolons-vs-not crusade.
- **Tests**: every behavior change comes with a test. Tests live under
  `tests/` and are run with `pytest tests/ -q`. The full suite (about
  2,240 tests) runs in a few minutes with no network dependencies; run
  the files you touched while iterating and the whole suite before
  pushing. Common fixtures (defined in
  [tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py)):
  - `client` — authenticated `TestClient`. Use for most tests.
  - `unauthed_client` — `TestClient` with no session. Use only for
    auth-flow tests (setup, login, logout).
  - `db_session` — isolated SQLAlchemy session on the suite's file-backed
    SQLite database; each test runs inside a savepoint that is rolled
    back afterwards, and a sentinel fails the suite if a test leaks a
    row. Read `tests/test_*` for a test that talks to the ledger before
    writing one.
  - `seed_accounts` — chart-of-accounts pre-loaded.
  - `seed_customer` — a single active customer pre-loaded.

  Picking the wrong client fixture is the most common newbie miss:
  using `unauthed_client` against a protected route silently 401s.

## Project rules

Decisions the owner has made that a contributor would not guess from the
code. A PR that crosses one is asked to change, however good the code is.

- **USA only.** Tax, payroll, currency and address handling target the
  United States. Forks for other countries are welcome; the product does
  not claim support it cannot test.
- **The company's words, everywhere.** A nonprofit sees Pledge, Donor and
  Donation Receipt on every screen, every server message and every printed
  page. Page text goes through `T()` / `Terms.text` in JS and
  `terms.text()` in Python (every HTTP error crosses one chokepoint in
  `app/main.py`). **A posting says what the document is**, in the
  document's own words at posting time (`document_label`), and history is
  never rewritten. `scripts/audit/vocab_walk.py` measures a running server
  in both company types; the gate runs it.
- **A saved email template is the user's.** The product never rewrites
  one. Defaults may change; a template someone saved is left alone.
- **No importer for a named third-party format without a real exported
  file.** A format built from documentation alone is parked on a
  `parked/*` branch, contributor's commits intact, until a real file
  arrives. An importer that is absent fails loudly; one that is present
  and wrong lands silently in someone's books.
- **An error never tells the reader to do something they cannot do.**
  A frozen desktop build has no interpreter and no `alembic`; an
  instruction has to be one the program itself can carry out (the
  `--_repair-schema` flag exists for this reason).
- **The desktop and Server Edition are one program.** A page that only
  makes sense under the desktop shell checks for it
  (`window.pywebview.api`) and hides itself in a browser; the API never
  assumes a window.

## Adding a feature

A full feature touches all five layers — but **you don't always need
all five**. For a one-endpoint addition (e.g. `GET /api/hello`
returning a dict), skip straight to steps 4 + 6.

1. **Model** in `app/models/` — SQLAlchemy class plus any enum types
2. **Schema** in `app/schemas/` — Pydantic request/response shapes
3. **Service** in `app/services/` — business logic, when there is any
4. **Route** in `app/routes/` — `APIRouter` with `@router.get/post/...`
   decorators. Register it in `app/main.py`. Group routes by domain;
   add to the smallest related file, or create a new file for a new
   feature area. Don't pile unrelated endpoints into `main.py`.
5. **Frontend** in `app/static/js/` — vanilla JS module, registered as a
   hash route in `app/static/js/app.js`. Use the `API` helper from
   `app/static/js/api.js` — note `API.del` (not `API.delete`)
6. **Tests** in `tests/test_<area>.py` covering at least the happy path
   and one failure mode

### Tiniest possible example

A minimal route + test, end to end:

```python
# app/routes/hello.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter(prefix="/api", tags=["hello"])

@router.get("/hello")
def hello():
    return {"message": "hi"}
```

```python
# app/main.py — add the import + include
from app.routes import hello
app.include_router(hello.router)
```

```python
# tests/test_hello.py
def test_hello(client):
    r = client.get("/api/hello")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.json() == {"message": "hi"}
```

That's the whole flow — no model, no schema, no service, no frontend
needed for an endpoint that doesn't touch the DB.

### Backend-only endpoints

The wiring audit (`tests/test_wiring.py`) catches JS callers that
point at non-existent routes (forward direction) AND backend routes
that have no SPA caller (reverse direction). If your endpoint is
deliberately not surfaced in the SPA — a webhook, an admin-only
utility, a cron-job target — add it to `_INTENTIONAL_BACKEND_ONLY`
in `tests/test_wiring.py` with a one-line comment explaining why.
Otherwise the reverse test fails and the CI build is red.

## Schema conventions

### ⚠ The `date: date` field-name-shadows-the-type collision

This one has bitten us **eleven times** across the codebase. Pydantic
v2 still has it as of 2.13. If a model has a field named `date` AND
imports `date` from `datetime` without an alias, **`Optional[date]`
on the corresponding Update model silently breaks** — every value
validates as "Input should be None":

```python
# ❌ DON'T — the field name `date` shadows the type `date`,
#          so Optional[date] becomes Optional[<the field itself>]
from datetime import date
from pydantic import BaseModel

class InvoiceUpdate(BaseModel):
    date: Optional[date] = None    # Pydantic reads this as
                                    # Optional[FieldInfo] → must be None
```

```python
# ✅ DO — alias the import so the type name and field name
#         can never collide
from datetime import date as dt_date
from pydantic import BaseModel

class InvoiceUpdate(BaseModel):
    date: Optional[dt_date] = None
```

`tests/test_schemas_audit.py` enforces this — CI fails if any schema
imports `date` without `as dt_date` AND has a field literally named
`date`. Same rule applies for any other type whose name might collide
with a sensible field name (`time`, `datetime`, `id` — though only
`date` has bitten us in practice).

## Template rendering conventions

### ⚠ Jinja2 `Environment(...)` without `autoescape=True`

Jinja2 defaults `autoescape` to **False** — silently. Every HTML or
email template rendered through such an environment is XSS-vulnerable
when the context contains user-controlled strings (customer names,
memo fields, anything from a public-facing form). This has bitten us
twice — once in WC3D's commit `ca6182f` (`app/routes/public.py` +
`app/services/pdf_service.py`) and once in this branch's red-team
sweep (`app/services/email_service.py` SandboxedEnvironment + an
f-string fallback in the same module).

```python
# ❌ DON'T — autoescape defaults to False
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader
from jinja2.sandbox import SandboxedEnvironment

env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(template_dir))
env = SandboxedEnvironment()
```

```python
# ✅ DO — pass autoescape=True explicitly to every Environment
env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(template_dir), autoescape=True)
env = SandboxedEnvironment(autoescape=True)
```

And if you fall back to raw HTML interpolation (an f-string with
user-string fields), route each field through `html.escape()`:

```python
import html as _html
return f"<p>Dear {_html.escape(customer.name)},</p>"
```

`tests/test_jinja_autoescape_audit.py` enforces this — CI fails if
any `Environment(...)` or `SandboxedEnvironment(...)` call site in
`app/` is missing the `autoescape=` argument. The walker handles
nested calls like `Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(...))` so
the rule can't be defeated by indentation.

## Frontend ↔ backend wiring

Every `API.get/post/put/del` call must hit a real handler with a
matching method. After adding endpoints, sanity-check with:

```bash
grep -rEn "API\.(get|post|put|del)\s*\(" app/static/js/*.js
grep -rn "@router\." app/routes/*.py
```

See [docs/wiring-audit.md](docs/wiring-audit.md) for the methodology.

## Security-sensitive changes

If your change touches:

- Authentication or session handling
- Cryptography (anything reading `PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`)
- Field-level encryption (`app/services/encryption.py`)
- The portal token flow (`app/routes/portal.py`)
- File upload handling
- Subprocess invocations (currently only `pg_dump` / `pg_restore`)
- Any startup check in `app/main.py:startup_security_checks()`

…flag it in the PR description and read [docs/security-hardening.md](docs/security-hardening.md)
first. CI runs CodeQL on every PR but that's not a substitute for a
human eye on the diff.

## Documentation

User-facing changes need:

- **CHANGELOG.md** entry under `[Unreleased]` — what the user sees
  changing, not a re-tell of the diff
- Updates to relevant sections of **README.md** if the feature surface
  changed
- Updates to **docs/** for non-trivial behavior (portal flow, security
  posture, etc.)
- Internal-only TODO items go in **docs/todo.md** (not linked from
  README)

## Pull requests

- One feature or fix per PR. Refactors that touch many files are OK if
  they're mechanical and the PR description says so.
- Run the full test suite locally before pushing:
  `python -m pytest tests/ -q`
- Run formatters before pushing: `black app/ tests/`
- Fill in the PR template — it's there to remind you to mention test
  coverage, security implications, and migrations.

## Database migrations

SQLAlchemy's `Base.metadata.create_all()` runs at startup so a fresh
install always gets the latest schema. For changes to *existing* tables
that need to ship to a deployed instance, add an Alembic migration
under `migrations/versions/`. Run the migration locally against a snapshot
of a real DB before shipping.

## Reporting security issues

**Don't open a public issue for vulnerabilities.** See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the responsible disclosure path.

## Contributor Terms

You keep the copyright in what you write. By submitting a contribution
(a pull request, a patch, a fixture, a document) you agree to these terms,
which exist so the project can keep shipping your work and so the license
on it can change without going back to every author:

1. **License to the project.** You grant Trent Von Holten, and anyone who
   receives the Software from him, a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify,
   distribute, sublicense, and **relicense** your contribution as part of
   the Software, under the project's license or any other license he
   chooses in future. This is the same shape as the Apache and Google
   contributor agreements: you are not giving up ownership, you are giving
   the project a license broad enough to be relied on.
2. **You have the right to grant it.** The contribution is your original
   work, or you have the right to submit it under these terms — including
   from your employer if you wrote it on their time or equipment, and
   including for any third-party code you brought in, whose license you
   name in the PR.
3. **Patents.** To the extent you hold patent claims that your contribution
   would infringe on its own or combined with the Software, you grant the
   same recipients a license under them for the Software.
4. **No warranty from you either.** Contributions are provided as-is, the
   same way the Software is.

**How you agree:** add a sign-off line to every commit —

    git commit -s

— which appends `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>`. That line is
the record that you read these terms and have the right to contribute the
change. Pull requests without it are asked for it before review, not
rejected. The PR template repeats the four points as a checkbox.

If you contributed before this section existed (September 2026), your work
is in the Software under the license it shipped with, and these terms apply
to anything you contribute from here on. Thank you.
