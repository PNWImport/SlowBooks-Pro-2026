# ============================================================================
# Slowbooks Pro 2026 — "It's like QuickBooks, but we own the source code"
# An independent, from-scratch replacement for Intuit QuickBooks Pro 2003.
# No Intuit source code or binaries were decompiled, disassembled, or used.
# Everything derives from published SDK documentation (QBFC 5.0, qbXML 4.0),
# IIF files exported by our own licensed copy, and 14 years of using the
# product as a paying customer. Intuit's activation servers have been dead
# since ~2017; the hard drive with our licensed copy died in 2024. We just
# want to print invoices.
