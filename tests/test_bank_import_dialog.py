whole round trip and the button stayed live, so a second click put a second
parse in flight. And the dialog's own label — the one place a user is
choosing a file — did not name Bank of America in the release named for it.

String-level, deliberately: the handler is a template literal in a page
module with no test harness, and what is being pinned is that the three
things are present and in the right order."""
