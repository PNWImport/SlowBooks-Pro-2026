"""A typed exchange rate is never replaced by the looked-up one (2.18.0
gate, skytech N1).

Choosing EUR on an invoice asks the exchange-rate feed for the day's rate.
A rate typed while that lookup was still answering was overwritten about
three seconds later (1.10 became 1.13976670), and the invoice booked at the
feed's rate without a word: 850 EUR posted as $968.80, not $935.00. The
looked-up rate now fills the field only while nobody has typed in it since
the currency was chosen, and an answer for a currency since changed is
dropped.
