"""An administrator can clear the folder earlier versions shared (2.18.0).

Before 2.18.0 every company on an install wrote its uploads into one folder
(storage.uploads_root()). Each company now keeps its files in its own
database, and the upgrade copies a company's files in from the folder the
first time that company is opened on 2.18. The folder is no longer read,
but it stayed on disk with every old logo, attachment and employee document,
the old copy of a document deleted since among them, and nothing removed it.

GET /api/uploads/legacy says what it holds and which companies still have to
copy their files from it; DELETE removes the regular files in it once none
does, and never the folder itself, anything reached through a link, or
anything outside it. Both are the administrator's.
