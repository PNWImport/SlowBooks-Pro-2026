"""The upgrade copies each company's files in from the shared folder (2.18.0).

Before 2.18.0 every company on a desktop install kept its uploads in one
shared folder, and the rows only held paths into it: company_logo_path
"/static/uploads/company_logo.png", attachments "uploads/attachments/...",
with backslashes when Windows wrote them (employee documents and scanned
receipts used str() on a WindowsPath). Migration c5e1f7a9b3d2 copies, once
per company, each file that company's rows point at into its own database:

- every copy is flagged from_shared_folder, because nothing ever recorded
  which company wrote a shared file (the file at a path is the LAST one
  written there, possibly by another company), and the app says so;
- a file that is not there is recorded as missing, not an error;
- a stored path never reads outside the uploads folder;
- the shared files are left where they are: another company may still
  need its copy;
- running the copy again copies nothing twice.

Runs on SQLite always, and on PostgreSQL when SLOWBOOKS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL
names a server the test may create a scratch database on (for example
postgresql:///postgres as a local superuser).
