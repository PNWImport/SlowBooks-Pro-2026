"""Settings -> Closing Date says whether one is set, and clears in one click
(explore 2.17.3, macbase1 S-i).

An empty date field shows today's date in grey on macOS, which reads like
"closed through today", and clearing a set date meant emptying three date
segments by hand (WebKit could leave them half-empty and silently invalid).

2.18.0 gate, macbase1 NEW-1: Clear set `value = ''`, which on macOS leaves
WebKit's date segments holding the old date, the field invalid with an empty
message and the form unable to submit: Save Settings sent nothing, for any
setting, until a reload. And the line under the field described the field,
not the books, so it said "No closing date: every period is open." while the
closing date was still in force. Clear now rebuilds the field empty, and the
line says what is saved, then what Save Settings would change.
