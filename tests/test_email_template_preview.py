"""Previewing a template edit before saving it.

#140 gave the send dialog a preview of the mail it is about to send. This is
the other half: the operator editing `invoice_email` under Settings -> Email
Templates could only see the result by saving over a working template and
mailing a real customer. The preview renders what is currently typed, against
a real invoice, without writing or sending anything.

It deliberately renders through `email_service.template_env()` — the same
environment the send uses — because a preview under different rules than the
mail is how the template and the send drifted apart in the first place.
