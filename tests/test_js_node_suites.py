"""The browser-side suites written for node's own test runner.

tests/js/*_probe.js print JSON for a pytest test to read. The *.test.cjs
files (#192: the invoice logo option, the QBO import log) use node:test
and assert for themselves, and nothing ran them: CI runs pytest, and no
pytest test named them. Each one runs here with `node --test`, and a
failing case, or an error thrown after a case ended, fails the build.
