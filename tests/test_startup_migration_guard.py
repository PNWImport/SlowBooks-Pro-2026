"""The app refuses to start against a database behind the migration head
(issue #132).

Found by the macOS QA agent while gating 2.11.0. `_create_missing_tables()`
runs `create_all()` on every start. Point that at a database behind head and
it half-upgrades it: tables the new revision ADDS are created, tables it
ALTERS are untouched, and `alembic_version` does not move. Alembic can then
never run on it again, because the upgrade tries to create tables that
already exist.

The agent's own company file ended up carrying three 2.11 tables, missing
2.10's `accounts.bank_kind`, and still stamped at a 2.9-era revision. The
app refused to start, and the start that failed was not the start that
caused it.

Neither shipped path reaches this — `desktop_launcher.py` migrates first and
`docker-entrypoint.sh` runs `alembic upgrade head` at line 21 — but a
self-managed deployment that sets DATABASE_URL and treats migrations as a
separate operational step is on exactly that path.
