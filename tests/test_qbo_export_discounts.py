"""A line on a Discount item exports to QuickBooks Online as QBO's own
discount (2.18.0).

A discount from QBO comes in as a negative line on a Discount item. The
export wrote every line as a sales line, so that discount would have gone
back to QBO as a negative sales line with no item. It now goes as a
DiscountLineDetail on QBO's discount account (the one the Discount item
came in on), one for each Discount item, with the tax worked out after it
when it came off the taxable amount. A negative line on any other item
exports as it did.

The invoice is built as the export builds it, with the python-quickbooks
SDK's own Invoice; its save (the call to QBO) is where the test reads it.
