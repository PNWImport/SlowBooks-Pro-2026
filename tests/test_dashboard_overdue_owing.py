"""The dashboard's overdue lists count what is owed (2.18.0 gate, skytech N7).

A $0.00 invoice made before 2.18.0 (which now starts one as paid) is still a
draft or sent, so on an upgraded company the Overdue Invoices card listed it
at $0.00 and Total Receivables counted it as overdue: the queries read the
status and the due date, never the balance. They require a balance now, on the
payable side too.
