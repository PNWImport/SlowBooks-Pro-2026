"""An editable email template cannot read a credential (GHSA-c3v4-f43f-4wqm).

Reported privately under SECURITY.md. `get_all_settings()` decrypts on the
way out, and the acknowledgment letter was rendered against the raw result —
so a template containing `{{ company.smtp_password }}` rendered the live SMTP
password, and `{{ company }}` dumped every credential at once, into an email
addressed to whoever the sender chose.

`GET /api/settings` redacts these keys for every role including admin, so the
intent has always been that they do not leave the server. Jinja's
`SandboxedEnvironment` is no help: `company` is a plain dict and reading a key
from it is an ordinary permitted operation, not a sandbox escape.

**It is privilege escalation.** A bookkeeper principal cannot write settings
and gets the redacted read, but can edit a template and trigger a send — so a
role specifically denied these values can mail them to an external address.

**Widened by this release before it was caught.** Issue #140 made the
`invoice_email` template actually render, having never been loaded by
anything. That took the exposure from nonprofit installs sending
acknowledgments to *every* install sending an invoice. These tests cover both
paths, and the redaction is applied where each context is built rather than at
the call sites.
