"""A sidebar link works after a toolbar button (2.18.0 gate, macbase1 NEW-9).

The toolbar's Home, Quick Entry and Reports called App.navigate() without
changing the address. The page changed, the hash did not, so the sidebar link
of the page just left did nothing: clicking it set the hash it already had,
and no hashchange fired. Settings -> toolbar Home -> sidebar Settings stayed
on the Dashboard until some other page was visited. The keyboard shortcuts,
search results and pages that move on by themselves had the same gap.

App.navigate now keeps the address in step (history.pushState, which gives
Back an entry and fires no second navigation), whoever calls it. The probe
drives app.js and bootstrap.js on a page whose address behaves like a
browser's.
