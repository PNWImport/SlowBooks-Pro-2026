"""Issue #119 — a document must never be accepted without its journal entry.

Reported by wilsons043 against the v2.10.0 Windows release: renumbering
Accounts Receivable away from 1100 made every later invoice post nothing,
while still returning 201 and still appearing in the A/R aging.

The reproduction is the first test here, written the way the reporter drove
it, and it asserts the thing that actually matters: the sub-ledger and the
general ledger agree. Note that the *old* behaviour kept the trial balance
balanced — debits equalled credits throughout — so a balance check can never
catch this class. Only the tie-out can.
