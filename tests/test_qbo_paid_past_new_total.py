"""A QuickBooks Online change that takes an invoice below the payments
recorded against it here is left, by both imports (2.18.0).

The document import already refused to bring such a change in (the
invoice would owe less than nothing), but the ledger import posted QBO's
new version of the invoice anyway: the invoice kept its old total while
the ledger took the new one, so A/R Aging and the A/R account disagreed.
Now neither applies it, the invoice and its posting stay in step, and the
run's log says why in one line, however many of the two steps ran. Once a
payment comes off the invoice here, the next import brings the change in.

Built through the python-quickbooks SDK's own objects (tests/
test_qbo_managed_voids.Books: invoice 1037, 50.00, 20.00 paid in QBO;
invoice 1038, 40.00).
