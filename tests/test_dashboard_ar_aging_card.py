"""The dashboard's A/R Aging card adds up to Total Receivables (2.18.0 gate,
macbase1 NEW-5).

The card summed open invoice balances by itself, so it read "Current $323.56"
beside a Total Receivables card of $303.56: the $20.00 a customer paid without
applying it to an invoice was in one figure and not the other. It also counted
a foreign-currency invoice at its face amount. Both cards now read the A/R
Aging report's TOTAL row, and the aging card shows the credits on their own
line and the total, as the report page does.
