"""Recovering a half-upgraded database (issue #132, second half).

The guard added in this release refuses to start against a database behind
head, which stops the damage happening again. It does nothing for a file it
has already happened to — and @skytech pointed out the distinction while
gating 2.12.0:

    `alembic upgrade head` recovers an *ordinary* old file and can never
    recover a *half-upgraded* one, because the tables the next revision
    creates already exist.

Measured before building this: a file at `e7f8a9b0c1d2` that a server touched
gains three empty tables, keeps its revision, and then

    alembic upgrade head
    -> OperationalError: table vendor_credits already exists

So the refusal was printing advice that fails for exactly the people who hit
it — the same shape as #139's delete error saying "deactivate it instead"
when nothing on the page could deactivate.
