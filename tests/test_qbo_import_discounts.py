"""A QuickBooks Online discount comes across with its invoice or sales
receipt (2.18.0).

The import brought a QBO document's sales lines and QBO's totals, but not
its discount line (DiscountLineDetail): the lines added up to more than
the document, and an edit here re-totalled it without the discount, or
(2.18.0's first answer) posted the difference to the income account. Now
the discount is a negative line on a Discount item whose income account is
QBO's discount account, so the lines add up to QBO's subtotal, tax and
total, an edit keeps them, the document's own posting books the discount
where QBO did, and the Sales Tax report sees QBO's taxable amount.

Built through the python-quickbooks SDK's own objects, as the import reads
them: an invoice's lines are typed, a sales receipt's are plain dicts.
