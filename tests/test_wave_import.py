"""Wave import: the "Account Transactions" report is a plain export any
Wave user can pull with no plan restrictions, but its headers
("ACCOUNT NUMBER" for what is actually the account name on every data
row, "DEBIT (In Business Currency)" / "CREDIT (In Business Currency)"
for the money columns) didn't match parse_gl()'s alias list. Every row
silently parsed as account="" / debit=credit=0, so the dry-run
"balanced" on all-zero amounts and failed once, deduped, on the GL
account-name check ("GL references account '' not present in the
