"""LICENSE section 13: the desktop app and the Windows installer display the
short terms before first use and record that they were shown. A file on
GitHub is not a contract with someone who only ever double-clicked the
installer; these pin the two places the terms are actually put in front of
a person, and that they say the same version the license does.
