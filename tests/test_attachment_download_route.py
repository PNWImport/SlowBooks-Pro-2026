"""The download route must actually be reachable.

Found by macbase1 and reproduced by skytech during the 2.10.3 gate. FastAPI
matches routes in declaration order, and

    @router.get("/{entity_type}/{entity_id}")   # entity_id: int
    @router.get("/download/{attachment_id}")

means GET /api/attachments/download/2 binds the FIRST one — entity_type
"download", entity_id 2 — and answers `[]`. The download route was never
reached. You could attach a file and never get it back.

That shipped for as long as both routes have existed, and no test caught it
because every test called the handler's logic rather than its URL. These
tests go through the URL a user's browser goes through.
