"""Auth contract: every /api route rejects unauthenticated requests.

The session middleware in app.main gates everything except an explicit
exempt list. This test walks the ACTUAL route table and proves the
contract holds for every registered route — so a new router that
accidentally lands outside the middleware (or a future exemption typo
that over-matches) fails CI instead of shipping an open endpoint.

Ported concept from the joelmacklow fork's sensitive-route auth
contract suite, re-derived against this app's route table.
